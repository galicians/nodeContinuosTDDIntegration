## Node App to post Jobs

The goal with this project is to integrating the testing and deployment on the development process.

Integrating the TDD with the development process we will avoid outdated tests or no tested code.

We will build a Job posting App.

We will use npm to manage the node packages and bower to manage our web components.

###Node packages:
express to create the app
jade as view template

###Bower components:
angular

Express server is running at localhost, port 3000. In case there is an environment variable indicating another port it will listen on that specific port.
